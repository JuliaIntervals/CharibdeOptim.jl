# Charibde: a Cooperative Approach

### Hybridization of Stochastic and Deterministic Techniques

Our hybrid algorithm Charibde (Cooperative Hybrid Algorithm using Reliable Interval-Based methods and Diï¬€erential Evolution), combines a stochastic DE and a deterministic IBC for non-convex constrained optimization. Although it embeds a stochastic component, Charibde is a fully rigorous solver.
